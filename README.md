Searchspeare
============

An Android app designed to help students and Shakespeare enthusiasts find quotes in Shakespeare works. 
They can search with a keyword either in the text or related to a quote 
(i.e. Hamlet's "If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart/Absent thee from felicity awhile" to Horatio can be found
with a search for 'felicity' or for 'suicide').
